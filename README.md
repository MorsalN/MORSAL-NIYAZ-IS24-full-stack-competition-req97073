## Code Challenge Context

The BC Government Ministry of Citizens' Services Information Management Branch (IMB) is currently trying to catalog current modern web applications in GitHub, as well as new products that are coming up in the future. Currently there are 40 products marked for modernization that need to be cataloged, as well as 3 products that are either actively being developed or in a maintenance lifecycle.

Product owners have expressed the desire to communicate to the branch where these products are housed (GitHub Repository).

The user base for this application will include a wide array of technical skills, therefore making this application as simple as possible to display, create and edit information is being stressed by the IMB Senior Leadership Team (SLT).
